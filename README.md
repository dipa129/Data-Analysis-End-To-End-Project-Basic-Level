  # 2. 🍽️ Zomato Data Analysis Project

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a Zomato restaurant dataset to extract insights about restaurant types, ratings, cost preferences, and online ordering behavior in India.

## 📊 Objective

To uncover patterns and insights from restaurant data that can help customers, business owners, or marketing strategists understand user preferences and operational trends.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and cleaning
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
- **Seaborn** – Advanced visualization and statistical plotting

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset used is `Zomato data.csv` and contains details such as:
- Restaurant names
- Ratings
- Votes
- Type of service (Delivery, Dine-out, etc.)
- Average cost for two
- Online ordering availability
- Cuisine and locality info

## 🧪 Key Steps Performed

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed unnecessary columns
- Converted rating data from string (e.g., `"4.1/5"`) to float
- Handled null and inconsistent values

### 2. Data Visualization & Insights
- **Restaurant Type Analysis:** Majority are in the *Dining* category.
- **Votes by Type:** Dining restaurants receive the highest number of votes.
- **Rating Distribution:** Most ratings fall between 3.5 to 4.5.
- **Cost Analysis:** Couples prefer restaurants with average cost around ₹300.
- **Online vs Offline Rating:** Online orders receive better ratings than offline.
- **Heatmap:** Online order preference by restaurant type.

## 📌 Conclusions

- **Dining** is the most popular and highest-rated type of restaurant.
- People tend to spend moderately (around ₹300) when dining.
- Online ordering generally leads to better customer satisfaction.
- Visual tools like boxplots and heatmaps helped confirm trends.
